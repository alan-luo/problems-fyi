# Problems.fyi

Problems.fyi is a site to support self-directed learning of advanced mathematics at the university level, inspired by projects like [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

It is specifically aimed at those who are looking to supplement or replace a traditional university education; namely, we aim to have parity and isomorphism with existing university curricula. It is *not* meant to help you find a job (because it probably won't).

## Courses
- [Columbia University: Probability Theory (MATH 4155)](/Courses/Columbia-MATH4155.md)

## Textbooks
- [Resnick, Sidney. _A Probability Path_, 1999.](Textbooks/Resnick_Sidney__A_Probability_Path.md)
- [Stirzaker, David.Â _Elementary Probability_, 2nd edition, 2003.](Textbooks/Stirzaker_David__Elementary_Probability_2ed.md)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why did you create yet another learning website?**

A: We think that there are certain difficulties unique to learning math.

**Q: Why is it hosted on Github pages?**

A: Without the support of a big institution like MIT, we want to make sure that the information here stays online for posterity. We don't want to rely on a particular tech stack or leadership in order to keep the site up. Technically, we could put up a server and database in order to make the site resemble something like [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org/) more. But the way it's structured now, even if Github goes down, the site will still be runnable as a local [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) site, since it's comprised entirely of Markdown files.
